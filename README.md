# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

Replace this paragraph with your own summary of what your version does.

## How The System Works

Real music platforms often combine collaborative filtering, which learns from listening patterns, likes, skips, and playlists from similar users, with content-based filtering, which compares a listener's preferences with song attributes. This project prioritizes a simple, explainable content-based approach: each `Song` also records popularity, release decade, detailed mood tags, explicit status, and instrumentalness, while each `UserProfile` can set targets for these features. The recommender scores genre, mood, energy, and these added attributes, then ranks songs by total score.

### Algorithm Recipe

Choose `genre_first`, `mood_first`, or `energy_focused` with `python -m src.main --mode <mode>`; the default `all` compares each mode. The modes weight genre, mood, and energy similarity as `(3, 1, 1)`, `(1, 3, 1)`, and `(0.5, 0.5, 3)`. Add up to 0.5 popularity points using `0.5 * (1 - abs(song.popularity - target_popularity) / 100)`, 0.5 for an exact release-decade match, 0.5 per overlapping mood tag up to 1.0, and up to 0.3 for instrumentalness closeness using `0.3 * (1 - abs(song.instrumentalness - target_instrumentalness))`. Recommendations are selected greedily: each repeat artist loses 1 point and each repeat genre loses 0.5, based on songs already chosen. Set `diversity=False` in `recommend_songs` to compare the unadjusted ranking. These weights and penalties can favor particular features, while the small catalog and manually assigned labels limit variety and accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this
