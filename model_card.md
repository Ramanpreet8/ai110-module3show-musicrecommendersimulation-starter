# Model Card: Vibe Finder

## 1. Goal and Task

Vibe Finder recommends songs from a small catalog. It ranks songs using a user's favorite genre and mood, target energy, popularity, preferred release decade, preferred mood tags, and target instrumentalness. This is a classroom simulation, not a production music service.

## 2. Data Used

The catalog contains 18 songs, including pop, lofi, rock, jazz, ambient, synthwave, country, metal, classical, hip-hop, reggae, blues, folk, and funk. Each row also includes popularity, release decade, 2–3 mood tags, explicit status, and instrumentalness, alongside the original song, artist, and musical attributes. The score uses genre, mood, energy, popularity, decade, mood tags, and instrumentalness; explicit status is loaded but not scored. These sample records do not represent the full range of music or listeners.

## 3. Algorithm Summary

Choose one of three modes: genre-first weights genre/mood/energy at 3/1/1, mood-first at 1/3/1, and energy-focused at 0.5/0.5/3. An exact genre or mood match earns that mode's weight; energy similarity is `1 - abs(song energy - target energy)` times its weight. Popularity closeness adds up to 0.5, a matching release decade adds 0.5, each shared mood tag adds 0.5 up to 1.0, and instrumentalness closeness adds up to 0.3. The program adds the points, sorts songs from highest score to lowest, and returns the top five with reasons.

## 4. Observed Behavior and Biases

Changing the weights, adding features, and applying diversity penalties changed the rankings, but there are no listener ratings to show that the new rankings are more accurate. Energy has twice the maximum influence of a genre or mood match, and mood-tag overlap can add another point. Repeat-artist and repeat-genre penalties can push out a song that otherwise scored well, so they trade relevance for variety. Exact labels do not recognize related genres or moods, and the catalog has only a few examples for most labels. If a requested mood or genre is missing, recommendations rely more heavily on numerical similarities. Explicit status is not scored; tempo, valence, danceability, acousticness, listening history, and context are also ignored.

## 5. Evaluation Process

I ran the CLI for three ordinary profiles and two conflicting profiles. I checked the top-five rankings, score explanations, feature ranges, and score arithmetic. In the expanded run, High-Energy Pop's Sunrise City score is 6.00, equal to the displayed reason points: 1.00 genre, 1.00 mood, 1.74 energy, 0.48 popularity, 0.50 decade, 1.00 mood tags, and 0.28 instrumentalness. Low-Energy Intense Rock now puts Quiet Constellations first, reflecting its low energy, popularity, decade, tags, and instrumentalness matches. There are no listener ratings to prove these results are accurate.

The terminal transcript and comparisons below preserve the earlier Phase 4 baseline run, before advanced features and scoring modes were added. Current mode comparisons are in the README.

### Profile comparisons

- **High-Energy Pop vs. Chill Lofi:** Pop and happy songs lead in the first profile; lofi and chill songs lead in the second because genre, mood, and target energy differ.
- **High-Energy Pop vs. Deep Intense Rock:** Storm Runner leads for rock and intense matches, despite both profiles preferring high energy.
- **High-Energy Pop vs. Sad High-Energy Pop:** Removing the happy mood match changes the leader to Gym Hero, which matches pop and energy.
- **High-Energy Pop vs. Low-Energy Intense Rock:** Lower target energy brings quieter tracks into the results, though Storm Runner remains first because of its genre and mood matches.
- **Chill Lofi vs. Deep Intense Rock:** Lofi/chill matches are replaced by Storm Runner's rock/intense matches.
- **Chill Lofi vs. Sad High-Energy Pop:** Changing genre, mood, and energy shifts the list from mellow lofi to energetic pop.
- **Chill Lofi vs. Low-Energy Intense Rock:** Both target low energy, but Storm Runner leads for the rock/intense profile because of its category bonuses.
- **Deep Intense Rock vs. Sad High-Energy Pop:** The matching genres and moods change, making Gym Hero lead for pop while Storm Runner leads for rock.
- **Deep Intense Rock vs. Low-Energy Intense Rock:** The category preferences stay the same, but the low target reduces Storm Runner's energy points; its genre and mood points keep it first.
- **Sad High-Energy Pop vs. Low-Energy Intense Rock:** Different category matches and target energy produce different results; Storm Runner's two category matches outweigh its energy mismatch.

## 6. Intended and Non-Intended Use

This tool is for learning how simple scoring and ranking work. It can demonstrate how changing preferences or weights changes a ranked list. It should not be used to make claims about a person's full taste, replace a real recommendation service, or make decisions about people.

## 7. Ideas for Improvement

Add more songs and more balanced examples for each genre and mood. Use tempo, valence, danceability, and acousticness in the score. Support multiple preferences and related mood or genre matches. Test recommendations against listener feedback and add a way to increase variety.

## 8. Personal Reflection

My biggest learning moment was seeing how every scoring weight and feature changes the order of the recommendations, without proving they are more accurate. I double-checked the AI's work by adding Sunrise City's listed points by hand and caught a loader bug when instrumentalness was treated as text instead of a number. I was surprised that the expanded features moved Quiet Constellations above Storm Runner for the low-energy rock profile. Next, I would add more songs and test recommendations with real listener feedback.
